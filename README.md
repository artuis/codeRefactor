# Code Refactoring for Horiseon Social Solution Services home page

## HTML Refactoring

Tags have been spaced apart to maximize legibility, and proper semantic tags (<header>, <footer>, <article>, <aside>) have replaced the <div> tags where appropriate. The title of the webpage was changed to the company name from nothing previously. Alt elements have been added to each picture, but due to the decorative nature of each image, the alt text was left blank. Heading numbering has also changed to follow a sequential order from top to bottom.

## CSS Refactoring

Comments describing the function of each styling or group of stylings has been added, as well as factoring of each styling into a single rule wherever possible.
